# M8_Booleans

M7booleans.py does multiple things first it takes 2 inputs from you and tells you if they are equal or not. The second thing it does is it takes the sum of two numbers and it tells you if it is less than, greater than or equal to 10. The third thing it does is it takes a list and tells you if the value 5 is in that list. The fourth thing it does is it takes a year and tells you if it is a leap year or not. The fifth thing it does is it gives you a list of items and weaknesses of a character. And the last thing it does is it checks a character inventory to see if he has the items to perform a certain task.

resources.py shows you the items and weaknesses of a character.
